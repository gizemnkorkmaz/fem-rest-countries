# REST Countries API

REST Countries API with color theme switcher is one of the Frontend Mentor challenges. It uses Composition API for Vue.js 3 and pulls data from the REST Countries API. It contains a dropdown feature for listing the countries by their continents and a search box for searching by their names. Each of the cards is clickable with detailed information about that particular country.
